# WIKIPEDIA-WEB-CRAWLER


Wikipedia Web Crawler is a simple web crawler that takes an input wikipedia URL("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random"),
it then takes the very first link of that page and then crawls that page  .


It can be observed that if you click the very first link of a wikipedia page and keep going , all most all of the wikipedia articles end up in philosphy 
page .


So our crawler stops when it sees PHILOSPHY page .
